This is a text editor application which provides you with autocomplete,misspelled words,flesch score of data based on how difficult it is to read it and many more functionality.
This is my currently ongoing project which is from an e-learning website in java.I have not implemented the code from scratch but have written all the functions in there.

The project include concepts of Strings,Linked List,Balanced binary search tree,tries,asymptotic analysis of which data structure is better and much more.My code is in the src file.

I have also shown my data in the form of graphs.You can check my implementation on:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-4MHUDlJv2b02nkf-MLR4kVvWXMDExAwJG6vTt3TMuk/edit#gid=0
